Read [OpenAI runtime](../../../references/openai-runtime.md) before executing. Host instructions, user scope, and existing authorization take priority. Role models and reasoning effort come from `.pstack/config.json` (`roles` and `panels`); the default is `inherit-parent`. Use only available subagent tools and supported fields; never create a user-owned task to simulate a subagent. Parallel lanes may run in bounded waves. Cloud isolation, different model families, scheduling, and transcript access are conditional capabilities, not promises. External messages, publishing, and merges require authorization for that action. A workflow mentioning PR creation runs that stage only when publication is authorized; otherwise finish and verify locally and prepare the reviewable change. Do not expand task scope to unrelated fixes. Missing live tools or evidence means blocked/untested, never PASS.

### Authoring or modifying a skill

**You own the skill's voice.**

1. Use the available **skill-creator** capability, or validate the documented SKILL.md format directly.
2. Validate the skill: frontmatter has `name` and `description`, referenced files exist, cross-skill links resolve.
3. Test cases if structural. Skip if subjective.
4. Run **Opening a PR**.

When in doubt, delete. Keep only prose that changes a decision. Tell it to do the thing and skip the reason. Explain only when the rule is confusing without one. Match tone to scope. Point at structural sources (types, READMEs, config) per the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill. Delegate to other skills by path. Don't restate. A workflow you keep hitting but isn't captured → propose a new skill.

**Reply:** summary of the skill, key design decisions, validation notes.
