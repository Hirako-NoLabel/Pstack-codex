Read [OpenAI runtime](../../../references/openai-runtime.md) before executing. Host instructions, user scope, and existing authorization take priority. Role models and reasoning effort come from `.pstack/config.json` (`roles` and `panels`); the default is `inherit-parent`. Use only available subagent tools and supported fields; never create a user-owned task to simulate a subagent. Parallel lanes may run in bounded waves. Cloud isolation, different model families, scheduling, and transcript access are conditional capabilities, not promises. External messages, publishing, and merges require authorization for that action. A workflow mentioning PR creation runs that stage only when publication is authorized; otherwise finish and verify locally and prepare the reviewable change. Do not expand task scope to unrelated fixes. Missing live tools or evidence means blocked/untested, never PASS.

### Trace forensics

**You own the diagnosis from the artifact. Load it, shape it, narrow to the cause, attribute to source.**

Distinct from **Runtime forensics**, which instruments the live process. Here the capture already exists. The artifact is a fixed dataset, read it, don't re-run it. Keep tooling generic so the playbook stays portable: a DevTools or trace parser for cpuprofile and `.json.gz`, a text editor for a spindump, your heap tooling for a heapsnapshot.

1. Identify the format and load it with the right tool. Parse large artifacts in a subagent (the **principle-guard-the-context-window** skill) and keep the reduced finding in the main thread.
2. Transform the raw artifact into a form you can query. Dump the trace or heap snapshot into sqlite, one row per sample, frame, or node. Reach the queryable shape before you read.
3. Narrow to the cause. Query for the frames that hold the most time and walk the call tree to the hot path. For a leak, follow the retainer chain from the leaked object to a GC root. For a spindump, find the thread stuck on-CPU or blocked and its wait reason.
4. Attribute to source. Map the hot frame to file, symbol, and line via the artifact's own symbols. A frame with no source mapping is not yet a diagnosis. Resolve the symbols, or say plainly the artifact does not carry them.
5. Confirm against a paired capture when you have one. Diff a before and after artifact. Without one, mark the finding as the strongest hypothesis the artifact supports, not a confirmed cause.
6. Hand back a cited diagnosis, no fix unless asked. Route to Bug fix or Perf issue once the cause is known. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only forensics`.

**Reply:** the artifact and format, the reduced finding, the source location, the artifact paths, and whether a paired capture confirmed it.
