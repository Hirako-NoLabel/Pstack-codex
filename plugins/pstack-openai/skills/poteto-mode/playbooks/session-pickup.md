Read [OpenAI runtime](../../../references/openai-runtime.md) before executing. Host instructions, user scope, and existing authorization take priority. Role models and reasoning effort come from `.pstack/config.json` (`roles` and `panels`); the default is `inherit-parent`. Use only available subagent tools and supported fields; never create a user-owned task to simulate a subagent. Parallel lanes may run in bounded waves. Cloud isolation, different model families, scheduling, and transcript access are conditional capabilities, not promises. External messages, publishing, and merges require authorization for that action. A workflow mentioning PR creation runs that stage only when publication is authorized; otherwise finish and verify locally and prepare the reviewable change. Do not expand task scope to unrelated fixes. Missing live tools or evidence means blocked/untested, never PASS.

### Session pickup

**You own the resume point. Read the prior trail, don't redo it.**

1. Locate the prior trail. An authorized project-scoped transcript or `context.mjs recall --repo <repo>` checkpoint, a cloud-agent URL, or a pushed branch. Read the metadata overview and last messages first, then scan back for the decision points. Parse a long transcript in a subagent and keep the reduced timeline in the main thread (the **principle-guard-the-context-window** skill).
2. Reconstruct operational state. The branch and worktree, what already landed (`git log`, `git diff` against the base), the open todos, the decisions made. The prior trail is authoritative input. Resist the bias to re-derive it.
3. Diff done vs pending. Compare what shipped against what was planned, name the resume point, do not re-run the prior repro or redo completed work. A "let me verify from scratch" pass means you're treating the trail as untrustworthy when it's authoritative.
4. Route the remaining work to the matching playbook and pick the verdict: continue the execution, ship a finished recommendation, ratify or override a prior conclusion, or postmortem a failed run. The pickup playbook ends here. The routed playbook owns the rest.
5. Verify the inherited claims against the original goal on the real artifact (the **principle-prove-it-works** skill). A passing prior self-report is not the proof.

**Reply:** where the prior agent stopped, what you inherited vs redid (ideally nothing redone), the resume point, and the outcome.
